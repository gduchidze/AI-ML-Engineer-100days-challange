# Topics

# Machine Learning:
To become proficient in machine learning algorithms, the most effective approach is to utilize the Scikit-Learn framework. Scikit-Learn provides a wealth of pre-defined algorithms that can be easily implemented by creating class objects. Familiarizing yourself with these algorithms is essential, especially those falling under the categories of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning:

Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Descent, Random Forest, Ridge and Lasso Regression,Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, KMeans Clustering .
Other important things to know:Principal Component Analysis , Recommender systems, Predictive Analytics, Exploratory Data Analysis . 

# Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is of paramount importance for Machine Learning (ML) engineers for several reasons. NLP enables ML engineers to work with human language data, which is prevalent in various applications and industries.

Handling Unstructured Text DataSentiment analysis,,Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis,Named Entity Recognition (NER),Text preprocessing,Text Generation and Language Translation,Topic Modeling,Machine Translation, BLEU Score,Summarization, ROUGE Score,Language Modeling, Perplexity,Building a text classifier, Speech Recognition .


# Deep Learning
The best way to master deep learning algorithms is to work with TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Neural networks basics,Activation functions,Backpropagation algorithm ,Popular deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow or PyTorch ,Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for computer vision ,Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequential data ,Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for data generation .

# Computer Vision
Computer vision is a fascinating field that involves teaching computers to understand and interpret visual information from images and videos, just like the human visual system does.

Working with OpenCV
Understanding Pretrained models like AlexNet, ImageNet, ResNet.
Neural Networks
Building a perceptron
